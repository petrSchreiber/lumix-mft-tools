# Lumix MFT tools

Collection of tools for Panasonic Lumix micro four thirds cameras.

## How to use?
All tools are created in free [thinBASIC](https://thinbasic.com/downloads.html#downloads) programming language.

This repository contains tools I use on daily basis as a hobby and thought somebody else could find them useful.

Use at own risk.

## Feedback
Should you find any issue, I will appreciate report in [Issues](https://github.com/petrSchreiber/lumix-mft-tools/issues) section.
